Weather Dashboard

This assignment was pretty straight forward. I enjoyed using the api for the weather as it provided an easy stepping stone to find the information i needed. I also used a forecast api and tying the information to each individual div worked well. I learned that having the same title of a div is possible when the parent div is different. It worked very well.
